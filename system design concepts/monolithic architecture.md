📌 What is Monolithic Architecture?
Monolithic Architecture is a traditional software design style where all components of an application are built and deployed as a single unit.
It's like a single-tiered, unified codebase that handles everything—from UI to database access.

🛠️ Example: E-Commerce Application (Monolith)
1️⃣ A single codebase contains:
• User Authentication
• Product Management
• Cart & Checkout
• Order Processing
• Payment System
• Admin Panel
2️⃣ All of the above are deployed as one application on a single server or instance.

📌 Key Characteristics
Feature	Description
Single Deployment	All features are deployed together in one package
Tightly Coupled	Modules depend heavily on each other
Shared Database	Often uses a common database for the entire application
Centralized Codebase	Code exists in one repository (often a monorepo)
Synchronous Communication	All functions are internal method calls

✅ Advantages of Monolithic Architecture
Advantage	Description
Simplicity	Easy to develop, debug, and test in early stages
Faster Development	Ideal for small teams and MVPs
Easy Deployment	Deploy as a single artifact (e.g., a WAR or JAR file)
Performance	Function calls are faster than inter-service communication
Centralized Logging & Monitoring	Easier to manage in a single place

🔴 Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture
Disadvantage	Description
Scalability Limits	Hard to scale individual components independently
Tight Coupling	Change in one module may affect others
Slower Builds/Deployments	Entire app must be rebuilt and redeployed for small changes
Limited Technology Flexibility	Hard to use different languages or frameworks per module
Reduced Fault Isolation	A bug in one module can crash the entire system

📌 When to Use Monolithic Architecture?
✅ Small teams or startups building an MVP
✅ Applications with simple and unified business logic
✅ Internal tools or back-office systems
✅ Projects where rapid development is more important than scalability
✅ When you need quick iterations and fewer operational overheads
________________________________________

📌 When NOT to Use Monolithic Architecture?
❌ When the application becomes too large and complex
❌ If you need independent deployment of components
❌ For teams working on different services simultaneously
❌ When you expect high traffic in isolated parts of the system
❌ If you want to adopt a polyglot tech stack

📌 Monolithic vs Microservices
Feature	Monolithic	Microservices
Codebase	Single, unified codebase	Multiple independent codebases
Deployment	One deployable unit	Each service is deployed separately
Scalability	Vertical (scale whole app)	Horizontal (scale specific services)
Tech Stack	Usually one tech stack	Allows multiple languages and tools
Failure Impact	One part fails, whole app may go down	Services fail independently, improving fault tolerance

🏗️ Real-World Examples
Company	Monolithic Usage (Earlier Stages)
Twitter	Started as a monolith, faced scaling issues, then moved to microservices
Shopify	Still runs on a large-scale monolith called "the monorail"
LinkedIn	Originally a monolith, later migrated to microservices

🔚 Final Takeaways
✔ Monolithic architecture is simple, fast to develop, and works well for small apps
✔ As complexity and scale grow, it becomes hard to manage and scale
✔ Ideal for MVPs, internal tools, and teams just starting out
✔ Transition to microservices only when the need for modularity, scaling, or agility becomes critical
