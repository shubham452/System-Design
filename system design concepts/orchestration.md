📌 What is Orchestration?
Orchestration is the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex systems, services, and workflows.
It ensures that microservices, containers, and infrastructure work in sync to deliver smooth operations.

🧠 Why is Orchestration Important?
In modern systems (especially microservices and containers), there are many moving parts. Orchestration tools help:
•	Deploy and scale services
•	Manage configurations
•	Handle failures and restarts
•	Maintain system health automatically

🔄 What Does Orchestration Handle?
Task	Description
🚀 Deployment	Launching and updating applications and containers
⚖ Load Balancing	Distributing traffic across services
🔄 Auto-healing	Restarting failed containers or services
📈 Scaling	Automatically adjusting resources based on load
🗂 Configuration Management	Injecting environment variables and secrets into services
🔗 Service Discovery	Letting services find and talk to each other dynamically

⚙️ Example: Kubernetes
Kubernetes is the most widely used orchestration tool.
Example workflow: 1️⃣ Developer pushes code to GitHub
2️⃣ CI/CD pipeline builds Docker image
3️⃣ Kubernetes deploys it as a pod
4️⃣ If the pod crashes, Kubernetes restarts it
5️⃣ It scales up automatically during high traffic

✅ Efficiency	Reduces manual intervention and errors
✅ Scalability	Handles dynamic scaling based on usage
✅ Reliability	Auto-restarts failed processes
✅ Portability	Works across cloud providers and on-prem
✅ Version control	Easy rollback and updates
