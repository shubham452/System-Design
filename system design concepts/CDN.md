# Content Delivery Network (CDN) Explained in Detail

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of servers that helps deliver content faster and more efficiently to users by caching it closer to their location.

## ‚úÖ Best For:
- Reducing latency and load times
- Handling high traffic efficiently
- Enhancing website reliability and availability

## üîπ How a CDN Works?

1. **User Requests Content**  
   - A user in India requests a video from Netflix.

2. **CDN Routes Request**  
   - Instead of fetching from the US data center, serves from a local Indian server.

3. **Content is Cached**  
   - If not available locally, fetches from origin server and caches for future requests.

4. **Faster Delivery**  
   - Subsequent users get content instantly from cache.

## üîπ CDN Example: Netflix Evolution

| Phase | Description | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Without CDN** | All videos stored in US data center | High latency, buffering |
| **With CDN** | Edge servers deployed globally | Reduced latency, instant playback |
| **Optimized** | Edge locations + load balancing + compression | Scalable, efficient delivery |

## üîπ Key CDN Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Edge Servers | Globally distributed cache points |
| Load Balancing | Distributes traffic to prevent overload |
| Caching | Stores popular content at edge locations |
| DDoS Protection | Mitigates large-scale attacks |
| SSL/TLS | Secure encrypted connections |

## üîπ CDN Performance Impact

| Metric | Without CDN | With CDN |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Latency | High | Low |
| Load Time | Slow | Fast |
| Reliability | Unstable | Highly available |
| Bandwidth | High usage | Optimized |
| Security | Vulnerable | Protected |
