📌 What is Multi-Tenancy?
Multi-tenancy is a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple customers (tenants), while keeping their data isolated and secure.
Think of it like an apartment building: one structure, many residents — each with their own space.

🧱 Key Characteristics
Feature	Description
Shared Infrastructure	All tenants share the same hardware and software instance.
Data Isolation	Each tenant's data is logically separated and cannot be accessed by others.
Customization	Tenants may have personalized UI, features, or configurations.
Cost Efficiency	Resources are optimized by sharing across tenants.

🧠 Real-World Analogy
🏢 Apartment Building
•	One building = One application
•	Multiple tenants = Multiple users or organizations
•	Each has their own apartment (data + configuration)

🛠️ Types of Multi-Tenancy Models
Model	Description
Shared Everything	Tenants share the same DB and app logic, with data separation via IDs.
Separate Schemas	Same DB, but each tenant has its own schema.
Separate Databases	Each tenant has its own database for stronger isolation.

🟢 Benefits of Multi-Tenancy
✅ Cost Savings – Shared infrastructure reduces operating costs
✅ Easy Maintenance – Single codebase to update for all tenants
✅ Scalability – Easy to add new tenants without deploying new instances
✅ Centralized Monitoring – One system to track performance for all tenants

🔴 Challenges of Multi-Tenancy
🚫 Security – Strong data isolation is crucial
🚫 Complex Customization – Handling tenant-specific needs can complicate the codebase
🚫 Resource Contention – One tenant consuming excessive resources can affect others
🚫 Data Migration & Backup – Must be handled per tenant to avoid overlap

📦 Multi-Tenancy vs Single-Tenancy
Feature	Multi-Tenancy	Single-Tenancy
Cost	✅ Lower (shared infra)	❌ Higher (dedicated infra)
Isolation	❌ Logical only	✅ Physical or logical
Customization	❌ Harder	✅ Easier
Deployment	✅ Faster (one app)	❌ Slower (one per tenant)
