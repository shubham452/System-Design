📌 What is OLAP?
OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing — a category of software tools that enable users to analyze multidimensional data interactively from multiple perspectives.
OLAP is used in business intelligence (BI) to support complex queries, data exploration, and decision-making.

🧠 Why Use OLAP?
Benefit	Description
✅ Multidimensional View	Analyze data by time, region, product, etc. (aka "dimensions")
✅ Fast Aggregations	Pre-aggregated data allows super-fast query responses for reporting & analytics
✅ Decision Support	Ideal for executives, analysts, and managers doing trends, forecasting, and insights
✅ Ad-Hoc Queries	Users can explore data without needing SQL expertise

🧪 Real-World Example
A retail company uses OLAP to analyze sales data:
•	By region (North, South, East, West)
•	By time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
•	By product category (electronics, clothing, furniture)
📊 A business analyst drills down from total sales → sales by region → sales by product → sales by month — instantly.

🔄 OLAP Architecture
1.	ETL Process → Extract, Transform, Load raw data into the data warehouse
2.	OLAP Cube Creation → Data is modeled in dimensions & measures
3.	Query Engine → Users send queries to explore data
4.	Front-End Tools → Dashboards, BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, Excel
