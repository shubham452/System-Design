📌 What is Rate Limiting?
Rate Limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests a client can make to a server in a given time window.
It protects systems from abuse, overload, and denial-of-service attacks, and ensures fair usage.
________________________________________

🛠️ Example: Login Endpoint
Imagine an API that allows user logins:
•	Without rate limiting: a hacker could try 10,000 password guesses per second
•	With rate limiting: only 5 login attempts per minute are allowed per IP
✅ This helps prevent brute-force attacks and server overload.

📌 Why Use Rate Limiting?
Reason	Description
🛡️ Prevent Abuse	Stops bots or malicious users from hammering APIs
🔒 Security	Protects against brute-force, scraping, or DDoS attacks
⚖️ Fair Resource Sharing	Ensures fair usage across all users
🚀 Performance	Keeps backend services healthy and responsive
💰 Cost Control	Reduces usage of metered APIs (e.g., 3rd party APIs like OpenAI, Stripe)

📌 Common Rate Limiting Algorithms
Algorithm	Description
Fixed Window	Allows X requests per fixed time window (e.g., 100/min)
Sliding Window	Uses a rolling window for more accurate rate tracking
Token Bucket	Tokens are added to a bucket over time; each request consumes a token
Leaky Bucket	Requests are processed at a fixed rate (leaks), even if bursty input comes

📌 HTTP Headers Used in Rate Limiting
Header	Meaning
X-RateLimit-Limit	Maximum allowed requests
X-RateLimit-Remaining	Requests left in the current window
X-RateLimit-Reset	Time (in seconds) until rate limit resets
Retry-After	When to retry after being rate-limited

✅ Tools & Services That Support Rate Limiting
Tool/Service	Feature Example
Nginx	limit_req_zone, limit_req modules
Cloudflare	Global rate limiting per path or IP
AWS API Gateway	Configure limits per method or user
Express.js (Node)	express-rate-limit middleware
Traefik / Envoy	Built-in rate limiting filters

📌 Rate Limiting in Real-World Apps
App/System	What's Rate Limited	Example Rule
GitHub API	API calls per user/token	5000 requests/hour
Twitter/X	Tweets, DMs, reads	300 tweets/day
Stripe API	Payment creation requests	100 requests/second
Firebase Auth	Sign-in attempts	5/min per IP for sign-in with email
________________________________________

🔴 What Happens When Rate Limit is Exceeded?
•	Server responds with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
•	May include Retry-After header to indicate cooldown
•	Client can back off or retry later

📌 Strategies to Handle Rate Limiting
Strategy	Description
Backoff	Wait and retry after a delay
Client Throttling	Limit requests on the client side
API Keys	Assign limits based on user plans
Prioritization	Let critical operations bypass limits

🔚 Final Takeaways
✔ Rate Limiting is critical for protecting APIs and backend services
✔ Choose an algorithm that matches your use case: bursty vs steady traffic
✔ Always provide clear feedback via headers for better client handling
✔ Implement both client-side and server-side rate limiting for robustness
