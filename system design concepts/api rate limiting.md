# 📌 What is API Rate Limiting?

API Rate Limiting is the process of restricting the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specific time window.  
It protects APIs from abuse, overload, or accidental traffic spikes.

## 🧠 Why is Rate Limiting Important?

| Reason                | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Prevent Abuse**  | Stops users from overwhelming your system with requests |
| ✅ **Ensure Fair Use** | Every user gets a fair share of access |
| ✅ **Maintain System Health** | Prevents resource exhaustion and downtime |
| ✅ **Improve Security** | Blocks brute-force attacks or DDoS attempts |

## 🧪 Example Scenario

A free weather API allows **100 requests per hour per user**.  
- 🧍 **User A** sends 80 requests → ✅ Allowed  
- 🧍 **User B** sends 120 requests → ❌ 20 requests blocked

## ⏱️ Common Rate Limiting Strategies

| Strategy          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 🔹 **Fixed Window** | Allows N requests per time window (e.g., 100 reqs per minute) |
| 🔹 **Sliding Window** | Smoother control by tracking timestamps of previous requests |
| 🔹 **Token Bucket** | Tokens are added at a fixed rate, requests need a token to proceed |
| 🔹 **Leaky Bucket** | Queue-based mechanism to ensure consistent rate over time |

## ⚙️ Implementation Tools

| Tool/Platform       | How It Helps |
|---------------------|-------------|
| 🔧 **NGINX**       | Built-in rate limiting using `limit_req_zone` |
| 🔧 **API Gateway** | AWS, Azure, GCP support rate limiting configuration |
| 🔧 **Redis**       | Store request counts and timestamps for custom logic |
| 🔧 **Kong / Tyk**  | API gateways with built-in rate limiting middleware |

## 🚦 HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **429** | Too Many Requests (Rate limit exceeded) |

## 🧰 Best Practices

| Practice                  | Benefit |
|---------------------------|---------|
| ✅ **Return Rate Limit Headers** | Help users know their limits and usage |
| ✅ **Customize by User Plan** | Allow more requests for premium users |
| ✅ **Log & Monitor**       | Detect misuse, spikes, or suspicious behavior |
| ✅ **Retry Mechanism**     | Clients can back off and retry after wait |

## 📌 Final Thoughts

✔ API Rate Limiting helps maintain **performance, reliability, and security**.  
✔ Choose the right strategy based on your traffic pattern.  
✔ Combine it with **authentication, throttling, and logging** for full control.
