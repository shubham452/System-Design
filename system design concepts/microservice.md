üìå Microservices in System Design
Microservices is an architectural style where an application is broken into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs.

When to Use Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
Factor	Monolithic Architecture	Microservices Architecture
Best for	Small applications	Large, scalable applications
Scalability	Hard to scale specific parts	Can scale individual services
Deployment	Entire application redeployed	Independent deployments
Development Speed	Faster for small teams	Faster for large teams working in parallel
Technology Choice	Single technology stack	Different services use different stacks
Fault Isolation	A bug can crash the whole system	A failure in one service doesn't affect others

Microservices Example: Uber
1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Phase (Monolithic System)
‚Ä¢	Uber started with a monolithic system where a single application handled:
o	User Authentication
o	Ride Matching
o	Payment Processing
o	Notifications
‚Ä¢	Problems:
o	As Uber expanded globally, a single database became a bottleneck.
o	Code changes affected the entire system, slowing down updates.
o	A failure in one feature (e.g., payment) could crash the whole system.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Transition to Microservices
‚úÖ Breaking the Monolith:
‚Ä¢	Uber split its system into microservices such as:
o	User Service (handles authentication)
o	Ride Matching Service (connects riders & drivers)
o	Payment Service (processes payments)
o	Notification Service (sends alerts & messages)
‚úÖ Database Sharding:
‚Ä¢	Instead of a single database, Uber used sharded databases for different microservices.
‚úÖ Asynchronous Communication:
‚Ä¢	Kafka (event-driven architecture) was used to allow services to communicate asynchronously.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Scalable System
‚Ä¢	Each service can be deployed independently without affecting others.
‚Ä¢	Auto-scaling: The ride-matching service can scale separately from the payment service.
‚Ä¢	Different technologies: Uber's ride-matching runs on Node.js, while payments use Java.
‚Ä¢	Fault isolation: If the notification service fails, ride-matching continues to work.

Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢	Use Monolithic Architecture for small applications where simplicity is key.
‚Ä¢	Use Microservices when the system needs to scale independently, handle high traffic, or support multiple tech stacks.
‚Ä¢	Use event-driven communication (Kafka, RabbitMQ) when microservices need to work asynchronously.
‚Ä¢	Use API gateways to manage communication between microservices efficiently.
