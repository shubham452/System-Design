📌 What is Failover?
Failover is the process of automatically switching to a backup system or component when the primary one fails or becomes unavailable.
It ensures that your application or system continues running without interruption, even if a part of it crashes.

🛠️ Example: Payment Gateway
Imagine you're making a payment on Amazon, and the main payment server crashes.
Instead of failing the transaction, Amazon automatically switches to a backup server — this seamless switch is called failover.

🔴 Why Failover is Important?
•	❌ Systems can crash due to hardware failure, software bugs, or network issues
•	❌ Downtime causes revenue loss and bad user experience
•	❌ Single points of failure make the system unreliable

🟢 How Failover Helps
1.	High Availability (HA)
Systems stay online even if one component goes down.
✅ Example: Gmail stays accessible even during server issues.
2.	Business Continuity
Users don't even notice the failure — service remains uninterrupted.
✅ Example: Online banking apps switch between servers during failures.
3.	Automatic Recovery
Systems detect failures and trigger the backup automatically.
✅ Example: Kubernetes restarts failed containers instantly.

📌 Components of Failover
Component	Description
Primary (Active)	The main node that handles all the traffic
Secondary (Standby)	Backup node waiting to take over if the primary fails
Failover Controller	Monitors the system and triggers failover when needed
Health Checks	Tools like heartbeat or ping to check if the primary node is still alive

📌 Types of Failover
1.	Active-Passive
o	One active system handles requests
o	A standby system is ready to take over
o	✅ Simple and cost-effective
o	❌ Passive system stays idle
2.	Active-Active
o	All systems are active and share load
o	If one fails, others handle its traffic
o	✅ High performance and redundancy
o	❌ Complex setup and conflict handling needed
3.	Manual vs Automatic
o	Manual: Human intervention needed to switch systems
o	Automatic: Failover happens instantly without user input

⚠️ Failover Challenges
•	Failover Delay: Switchover time may not be instant
•	Split Brain: Both nodes think they are primary → data conflict
•	Configuration Errors: Bad setup can lead to total system failure
•	Testing: Failover must be regularly tested for reliability

🧠 Real-World Examples
•	Netflix: Uses failover to switch between AWS regions if one fails
•	Google Cloud: Auto-failover for virtual machines and databases
•	PostgreSQL/MySQL: Primary-secondary setups with tools like Patroni or MHA
•	Kubernetes: Pods are restarted or replaced automatically on failure

📌 When to Use Failover?
✅ Mission-critical apps (e.g., banking, healthcare)
✅ SaaS platforms needing 24/7 uptime
✅ Systems with strict SLAs (Service-Level Agreements)
✅ Distributed systems and cloud infrastructure

✅ Final Takeaways
•	Failover is essential for high availability and fault tolerance
•	It ensures minimal downtime and smooth user experience
•	Choose between active-passive or active-active based on your needs
•	Regular testing and monitoring are critical for reliable failover
