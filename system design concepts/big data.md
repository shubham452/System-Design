## 📌 What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to extremely large and complex data sets that traditional databases and tools can't process efficiently. It requires special tools and frameworks for storage, processing, and analysis.  
**"Big" doesn't just mean size** — it also includes complexity, speed, and variety.
