# 📌 What is a Data Warehouse?

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized system used for storing, analyzing, and reporting large volumes of structured data from multiple sources.  
It is designed for **analytical processing (OLAP)**, not **transactional processing (OLTP)**.

## 🧠 Why Use a Data Warehouse?

| Benefit               | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Centralized Storage | Combines data from multiple sources (databases, APIs, logs) |
| ✅ Historical Analysis | Stores historical data for trend analysis               |
| ✅ Faster Querying     | Optimized for complex, read-heavy queries               |
| ✅ Business Intelligence | Powers dashboards, reports, and data-driven decisions |

## 🧪 Real-World Example

A retail company collects data from:  
• 🛒 **Online orders** (e-commerce)  
• 🏬 **In-store purchases** (POS)  
• 📦 **Inventory systems**  

All this data is ETL-ed into a Data Warehouse to generate:  
• 🔎 Sales trend reports  
• 📈 Inventory forecasting  
• 📊 Customer segmentation

## 🔄 Key Components

| Component       | Role                                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **ETL/ELT**     | Extract → Transform → Load data into the warehouse    |
| **Data Staging**| Temporary storage for raw data before transformation  |
| **Fact Tables** | Store measurable business data (sales, revenue)       |
| **Dimension Tables** | Store reference data (products, customers, time)     |
| **Query Engine**| Used to run analytical queries and generate reports   |

## 💡 OLAP vs OLTP

| Feature         | OLAP (Data Warehouse)         | OLTP (Databases)           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Analytics, Reporting           | Transactions (CRUD)        |
| **Query Type**  | Complex, read-heavy            | Simple, write-heavy        |
| **Data Structure** | Denormalized (star/snowflake) | Normalized                 |
| **Examples**    | Amazon Redshift, BigQuery      | MySQL, PostgreSQL          |
