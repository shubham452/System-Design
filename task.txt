In the Global Quality Management System (GQMS) project,
 you enhanced React.js components to facilitate document retrieval, including policies, work instructions, and procedures. By implementing filters such as document name, type, 
and location, you made document searches more efficient.

In the Device Implant Query (DIQ) project, you developed 
functionality to retrieve patient details based on device ID,
 last name, or date of birth. Your work included implementing 
search functionality to display all devices associated with a 
patient based on their last name
 and streamlining device-specific details retrieval 
using device ID searches.

n the Physician Collaboration Initiative (PCI) project, 
you established a comprehensive system to track courses
 and trainings for users. 
You managed speaker information and eligibility for 
lectures and implemented a robust financial tracking system for 
lecture-related expenses.
