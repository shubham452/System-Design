1. Requirements Gathering
Before diving into the design, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements.

1.1 Functional Requirements:
Generate a unique short URL for a given long URL

Redirect the user to the original URL when the short URL is accessed

Allow users to customize their short URLs (optional)

Support link expiration where URLs are no longer accessible after a certain period

Provide analytics on link usage (optional)

1.2 Non-Functional Requirements:
High availability (the service should be up 99.9% of the time)

Low latency (url shortening and redirects should happen in milliseconds)

Scalability (the system should handle millions of requests per day)

Durability (shortened URLs should work for years)

Security to prevent malicious use, such as phishing.
