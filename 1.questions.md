This is a comprehensive roadmap designed to take you from understanding concepts to implementing complex systems.

To maximize your efficiency, **do not** solve these questions linearly from 1 to 30. Instead, I have reorganized them by **Design Pattern clusters**. This allows you to master a specific pattern (like Strategy or Observer) and progressively increase difficulty within that context.

### **The Master Process: How to Solve Every Question**

For every question listed below, follow this strict 5-step loop. Do not write code until Step 3.

1. **Clarify & Scope (5 mins):**
* Define Actors (Admin, User, System).
* Define Use Cases (e.g., "User scans ticket," "System calculates fee").


2. **Diagramming (10 mins):**
* Draw the **UML Class Diagram** (Classes, Interfaces, Relationships).
* Identify where the design pattern fits (e.g., *"I will use Strategy here for Pricing"*).


3. **Skeleton Coding (10 mins):**
* Write the Interfaces and Abstract Classes first.
* Define the public API methods.


4. **Implementation (20 mins):**
* Flesh out the concrete classes.
* Handle thread safety (if applicable).


5. **Review (5 mins):**
* Ask: "If I add a new requirement (e.g., a new vehicle type), do I have to modify existing code?" (Open/Closed Principle).

This is the ultimate **Low-Level Design (LLD) Question Bank**, organized by **Design Pattern**.

I have consolidated every pattern we discussed (plus key ones we touched on) and provided **4–5 distinct interview questions** for each. I have tagged them by difficulty so you can see the progression.

---

### **1. Behavioral Patterns**

*Focus: Algorithms, object interaction, and responsibility assignment.*

#### **🔹 Strategy Pattern**

*Scenario: "I need to switch between different algorithms at runtime."*

1. 🟢 **Payment Processing:** Design a system where a user can pay via Credit Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin. The payment method should be swappable at checkout.
2. 🟢 **Navigation App (Google Maps):** Implement a route calculator that switches strategies between "Driving," "Walking," "Public Transport," and "Bicycling."
3. 🟢 **Game Character Abilities:** Design a game character that can switch weapons (Sword, Bow, Axe). Each weapon attacks differently.
4. 🟡 **Shopping Cart Discounts:** Implement a pricing engine where different coupons apply different logics (e.g., "Flat $10 Off," "10% Off," "Buy 1 Get 1 Free").
5. 🔴 **File Compression Tool:** Design a tool that compresses files using different algorithms (ZIP, RAR, 7z) based on user selection or file size.

#### **🔹 Observer Pattern**

*Scenario: "When A changes, B, C, and D need to know."*

1. 🟢 **Weather Station:** A weather station updates temperature. Display 1 (Phone), Display 2 (Billboards), and Display 3 (Website) must update automatically.
2. 🟢 **YouTube Channel:** Users subscribe to a channel. When a new video is uploaded, all subscribers get a notification.
3. 🟡 **Stock Market Ticker:** When a stock price changes, multiple analytics widgets and user dashboards must update in real-time.
4. 🟡 **Auction System:** When a bidder places a new high bid, all other bidders currently looking at the item must be notified of the new price.
5. 🔴 **Group Chat Application:** When User A sends a message to a group, the server must notify User B, User C, and User D (Observer + Mediator).

#### **🔹 State Pattern**

*Scenario: "An object behaves differently based on its current status."*

1. 🟢 **Traffic Light System:** Design a traffic light that cycles through Red, Yellow, and Green states.
2. 🟡 **Vending Machine:** Manage states like `Idle`, `Selection`, `MoneyInserted`, `Dispensing`, and `SoldOut`. Handling money return on cancel is key.
3. 🟡 **Media Player:** Design Play/Pause/Stop buttons. If "Playing," the Play button does nothing, but the Pause button pauses it.
4. 🟡 **Order Management System:** An e-commerce order goes through `Placed` -> `Processing` -> `Shipped` -> `Delivered` -> `Returned`.
5. 🔴 **ATM System:** Manage complex states like `CardReading`, `PinVerification`, `CashDispensing`, and `EjectingCard`.

#### **🔹 Command Pattern**

*Scenario: "I need to queue requests or support Undo/Redo."*

1. 🟢 **Smart Home Remote:** A remote has programmable buttons. Button 1 turns on the light, Button 2 opens the garage. Decouple the button from the device.
2. 🟡 **Text Editor (Undo/Redo):** Users type, delete, and copy-paste. Implement `Ctrl+Z` (Undo) and `Ctrl+Y` (Redo) using a stack of Commands.
3. 🟡 **Calculator App:** Implement a calculator where every operation (+, -, *) is a command, allowing users to scroll back through history.
4. 🟡 **Task Scheduler:** A job queue where tasks (Commands) are submitted to be executed later by worker threads.
5. 🔴 **Transactional Database:** Implement a simple transaction manager where operations can be "Committed" or "Rolled Back."

#### **🔹 Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

*Scenario: "Pass a request down a line until someone handles it."*

1. 🟢 **Logger Framework:** Design a logger where `Info` logs go to console, but `Error` logs go to console AND file AND email.
2. 🟡 **ATM Cash Dispenser:** User asks for $180. The $100 handler checks inventory, then passes the remainder ($80) to the $50 handler, then to the $20 handler.
3. 🟡 **Customer Support System:** A ticket starts at "L1 Support." If they can't solve it, it auto-escalates to "L2 Support," then to "Manager."
4. 🟡 **Form Validation:** A web form request passes through a chain: `AuthCheck` -> `InputSanitization` -> `DataValidation` -> `DatabaseSave`.
5. 🔴 **Middleware in Web Server (Express.js style):** Design a request pipeline where requests pass through Auth, Logging, and Compression layers before hitting the controller.

### **2. Structural Patterns**

*Focus: How objects are composed (wrappers, adapters).*

#### **🔹 Decorator Pattern**

*Scenario: "I need to add layers of features without changing the base code."*

1. 🟢 **Pizza Maker:** Start with a `BasePizza`. Allow users to wrap it in `Cheese`, then `Tomato`, then `Jalapeno`. Calculate the final cost.
2. 🟢 **Coffee Shop:** `Espresso` is the base. Decorate it with `Milk`, `Mocha`, `Soy`, `Whip`.
3. 🟡 **Text Formatter:** A string of text can be wrapped with `BoldDecorator`, `ItalicDecorator`, or `UnderlineDecorator` for HTML rendering.
4. 🟡 **Ice Cream Parlor:** Scoop of Vanilla -> Add Chocolate Syrup -> Add Sprinkles -> Add Waffle Cone.
5. 🔴 **Data Stream I/O:** Mimic Java’s I/O. Create a `FileStream`. Decorate it with `BufferedStream` for performance, then `EncryptedStream` for security.

#### **🔹 Adapter Pattern**

*Scenario: "Make incompatible interfaces work together."*

1. 🟢 **Power Adapter:** Simulate a US Plug (110V) trying to connect to a European Socket (220V).
2. 🟡 **Media Player:** Your player only supports MP3. Create an adapter to use a 3rd party library that plays VLC and MP4 files.
3. 🟡 **Payment Gateway Integration:** Your app uses `IPayment`. Adapt the `Stripe SDK` and `PayPal SDK` (which have different method names) to fit your interface.
4. 🟡 **Legacy Printer:** Your modern computer sends JSON data. The old printer only accepts XML. Write an adapter.
5. 🔴 **Stock Data Aggregator:** Fetch data from 3 different stock APIs (XML, JSON, CSV) and adapt them all to a single `StockData` object for your app.

#### **🔹 Facade Pattern**

*Scenario: "Hide complex logic behind a simple button."*

1. 🟢 **Computer Startup:** When you press the power button, the Facade handles `CPU.Freeze()`, `Memory.Load()`, `HardDrive.Read()`, `CPU.JumpTo()`.
2. 🟡 **Home Theater System:** "Watch Movie" button triggers lights, screen, projector, amplifier, and DVD player in the correct order.
3. 🟡 **Hotel Booking System:** A `TravelFacade` handles the complexity of booking a flight, then booking a hotel, then booking a taxi.
4. 🔴 **Video Converter:** A simple `convert(file, format)` method hides the complexity of Bitrate, Audio Codec, Video Codec, and Compression settings.

---

### **3. Creational Patterns**

*Focus: How objects are instantiated.*

#### **🔹 Factory / Abstract Factory Pattern**

*Scenario: "I don't know what exact object I need until runtime."*

1. 🟢 **Shape Factory:** Input "Circle" -> get `Circle` object. Input "Square" -> get `Square` object.
2. 🟡 **Notification Service:** Based on user preference, create an `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, or `PushNotification`.
3. 🟡 **Cross-Platform UI:** Design a UI factory that creates `WindowsButton` style on Windows and `MacButton` style on MacOS.
4. 🟡 **Restaurant Orders:** A `PizzaFactory` creates different pizzas (Veggie, Pepperoni) based on the menu selection.
5. 🔴 **Game Level Generator:** An `AbstractFactory` creates the theme for a level. `SciFiFactory` creates Aliens and Lasers. `MedievalFactory` creates Orcs and Swords.

#### **🔹 Singleton Pattern**

*Scenario: "There can be only one."*

1. 🟢 **Logger:** Ensure the entire app writes to the same log file instance.
2. 🟢 **Configuration Manager:** Load settings from `config.json` once and share it globally.
3. 🟡 **Database Connection Pool:** Manage a limited pool of connections. Ensure you don't create a new manager every time.
4. 🟡 **Load Balancer:** A single Load Balancer instance distributes traffic to multiple servers.
5. 🔴 **Hardware Interface:** Design a Controller for a Printer Spooler. Multiple threads send docs, but only one spooler manages the queue.

---

### **4. Multithreading & Concurrency**

*Focus: Thread safety, locks, and async operations.*

1. 🟢 **Print in Order:** Thread A prints "1", Thread B prints "2", Thread C prints "3". Ensure they run in order A->B->C.
2. 🟡 **Producer-Consumer:** Implement a Blocking Queue. One thread adds data, another removes it. Handle "Queue Full" and "Queue Empty" scenarios.
3. 🟡 **Thread-Safe Singleton:** Implement Singleton using Double-Checked Locking.
4. 🔴 **Dining Philosophers:** Five threads (philosophers) need two shared resources (forks) to run. Prevent deadlock.
5. 🔴 **Read-Write Lock:** Design a system where multiple threads can read a file simultaneously, but if one thread wants to write, all others must wait.

### **Suggested 2-Week Sprint**

* **Days 1-3:** Focus on **Strategy** & **Observer** (These are 50% of interviews).
* **Days 4-6:** Focus on **Factory** & **Builder** (Object creation is everywhere).
* **Days 7-9:** Focus on **Decorator** & **Adapter** (Structural design).
* **Days 10-14:** **Concurrency** (The hardest part).

**Week 2: The "Observer" Deep Dive**

* **Goal:** Master event-driven architecture.
* **Tasks:** Solve *Notification System* (Medium) and *Stock Trading System* (Hard).
* **Checkpoint:** Can you plug in a new "Subscriber" (e.g., a Logger) without changing the "Publisher"?

**Week 3: Concurrency & Hard Problems**

* **Goal:** Master thread safety and custom structures.
* **Tasks:** Solve *Rate Limiter* (Medium), *LRU Cache* (Hard), and *File System* (Hard).
* **Checkpoint:** Does your code handle 10 threads trying to access the resource simultaneously without crashing or data corruption?

### **Your Next Step**

Would you like to start **Week 1** right now? I can act as the interviewer for the **Parking Lot System** and ask you to define the requirements and class entities.
