This is a comprehensive roadmap designed to take you from understanding concepts to implementing complex systems.

To maximize your efficiency, **do not** solve these questions linearly from 1 to 30. Instead, I have reorganized them by **Design Pattern clusters**. This allows you to master a specific pattern (like Strategy or Observer) and progressively increase difficulty within that context.

### **The Master Process: How to Solve Every Question**

For every question listed below, follow this strict 5-step loop. Do not write code until Step 3.

1. **Clarify & Scope (5 mins):**
* Define Actors (Admin, User, System).
* Define Use Cases (e.g., "User scans ticket," "System calculates fee").


2. **Diagramming (10 mins):**
* Draw the **UML Class Diagram** (Classes, Interfaces, Relationships).
* Identify where the design pattern fits (e.g., *"I will use Strategy here for Pricing"*).


3. **Skeleton Coding (10 mins):**
* Write the Interfaces and Abstract Classes first.
* Define the public API methods.


4. **Implementation (20 mins):**
* Flesh out the concrete classes.
* Handle thread safety (if applicable).


5. **Review (5 mins):**
* Ask: "If I add a new requirement (e.g., a new vehicle type), do I have to modify existing code?" (Open/Closed Principle).

### **The Roadmap: Sorted by Pattern & Difficulty**

#### **Phase 1: The "Strategy" & "State" Cluster**

*Focus: Handling changing behaviors, rules, and lifecycles.*

| Difficulty | Question | Core Concept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Easy | **1. Parking Lot System** | **Strategy** (Pricing logic: Hourly/Daily), **Factory** (Vehicle types). |
| 🟢 Easy | **9. Vending Machine** | **State** (Idle, Selection, Dispense), **Strategy** (Cash/Card payment). |
| 🟢 Easy | **3. ATM System** | **State** (Auth, Transaction, Dispensing), **Singleton**. |
| 🟢 Easy | **10. Digital Wallet** | **Strategy** (Payment modes: UPI, Wallet, Bank). |
| 🟡 Medium | **13. Chess / Tic-Tac-Toe** | **Strategy** (Move validation), **State** (Game status: Won/Draw). |
| 🟡 Medium | **12. Cab Booking (Uber)** | **Strategy** (Pricing: Surge/Standard), **State** (Trip status). |
| 🟡 Medium | **19. Elevator System** | **State** (Moving Up/Down/Idle), **Strategy** (Dispatch algorithm). |
| 🔴 Hard | **22. Splitwise** | **Strategy** (Expense splitting: Equal/Exact/Percent). |
| 🔴 Hard | **30. Ride Dispatch @ Scale** | Complex **Strategy** matching drivers to riders. |

#### **Phase 2: The "Observer" & Event-Driven Cluster**

*Focus: Decoupling components, notifications, and updates.*

| Difficulty | Question | Core Concept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Easy | **2. Library Management** | **Observer** (Notify user when book available). |
| 🟢 Easy | **4. Movie Ticket Booking** | **Observer** (Notify on booking success/cancel). |
| 🟡 Medium | **18. Notification System** | **Observer** (Pub/Sub mechanism), **Factory** (Email/SMS). |
| 🟡 Medium | **11. Food Delivery (Swiggy)** | **Observer** (Track order status: Kitchen -> Driver -> User). |
| 🟡 Medium | **20. Payment Gateway** | **Observer** (Transaction callbacks/webhooks). |
| 🔴 Hard | **24. Messaging App (WhatsApp)** | **Observer** (Real-time message delivery). |
| 🔴 Hard | **27. Social Media Feed** | **Observer** (Fan-out on write: New post -> Followers' feed). |
| 🔴 Hard | **28. Stock Trading System** | **Observer** (Price ticks updating charts/orders). |

#### **Phase 3: Structural & Management Cluster (Factory/Singleton)**

*Focus: Object creation, resource management, and composition.*

| Difficulty | Question | Core Concept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Easy | **5. Hotel Management** | **Builder** (Room config), **Singleton** (Booking Manager). |
| 🟢 Easy | **7. Inventory Management** | **Factory** (Product types), **Singleton** (Inventory store). |
| 🟢 Easy | **8. Online Quiz System** | **Factory** (Question types: MCQ/Text), **Strategy** (Scoring). |
| 🟡 Medium | **14. Logging Framework** | **Chain of Responsibility** (Info -> Debug -> Error), **Singleton**. |
| 🔴 Hard | **21. File System (Unix)** | **Composite Pattern** (Directory contains Files/Directories). |

#### **Phase 4: Concurrency & Data Structures (Advanced)**

*Focus: Thread safety, caching, and custom data structures.*

| Difficulty | Question | Core Concept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟡 Medium | **15. Rate Limiter** | Thread-safety, Token Bucket logic, **Decorator**. |
| 🟡 Medium | **16. Producer-Consumer** | `BlockingQueue`, `wait/notify`, Synchronization. |
| 🟡 Medium | **17. Thread Pool Executor** | Managing worker threads, Task Queue. |
| 🔴 Hard | **23. Cache System (LRU)** | Doubly Linked List + HashMap, Eviction Strategy. |
| 🔴 Hard | **25. URL Shortener** | Hashing logic, Database abstraction (Repository). |
| 🔴 Hard | **26. Search Autocomplete** | **Trie Data Structure**, Efficient traversal. |
| 🔴 Hard | **29. Distributed Queue** | Managing partitions, offsets, and consumer groups. |

### **Action Plan: How to Execute This Strategy**

**Week 1: The "State & Strategy" Bootcamp**

* **Goal:** Master replacing `if-else` chains with Polymorphism.
* **Tasks:** Solve *Parking Lot* (Easy), *Vending Machine* (Easy), and *Cab Booking* (Medium).
* **Checkpoint:** Can you add a new "Pricing Model" or a new "Vehicle Type" without changing the existing class code?

**Week 2: The "Observer" Deep Dive**

* **Goal:** Master event-driven architecture.
* **Tasks:** Solve *Notification System* (Medium) and *Stock Trading System* (Hard).
* **Checkpoint:** Can you plug in a new "Subscriber" (e.g., a Logger) without changing the "Publisher"?

**Week 3: Concurrency & Hard Problems**

* **Goal:** Master thread safety and custom structures.
* **Tasks:** Solve *Rate Limiter* (Medium), *LRU Cache* (Hard), and *File System* (Hard).
* **Checkpoint:** Does your code handle 10 threads trying to access the resource simultaneously without crashing or data corruption?

### **Your Next Step**

Would you like to start **Week 1** right now? I can act as the interviewer for the **Parking Lot System** and ask you to define the requirements and class entities.
